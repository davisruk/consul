# For config params below the app will look under
# the following consul key:
# /config/${spring.application.name}/
# spring.application.name is set in application properties
# For discovery if you are using Consul in a docker container
# and your app is running outside the container
# you need to provide the hostname (for the app not for consul).
# This is because spring will use localhost as the service
# address of your app if you have no domain. Consul uses
# the hostname to call a /health service on the app to check its
# state; localhost obviously refers to its own container in this
# context so the check will fail and Consul could decide
# to deregister your service!!
